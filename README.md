# OpenWrite

**AI-powered writing platform for novelists & screenwriters. ‚ú®üìù**

OpenWrite is a comprehensive writing platform that empowers authors to write better stories faster. It combines intelligent AI assistance with powerful organization tools to help you plan, write, and collaborate on your creative projects.

## What OpenWrite Does

OpenWrite is a comprehensive AI-powered writing platform that transforms how authors create and structure their stories. The platform features a rich text editor with intelligent AI assistance that understands your characters, plot, and writing style, offering contextual suggestions as you write. The standout Story Canvas provides an interactive visual workspace where you can drag and drop story elements‚Äîfrom high-level acts and chapters down to individual scenes and beats‚Äîand connect them to map your narrative flow. Each story element can be detailed with goals, conflicts, character involvement, and thematic connections, creating a living blueprint of your work.

The platform integrates multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, and local models) directly into the writing experience, while robust organization tools help manage character databases, locations, and world-building through the Codex system. Real-time collaboration features enable teams to work together with live editing and version control, while built-in analytics track writing progress, word counts, and productivity patterns.

OpenWrite combines the best features of Sudowrite and NovelCrafter into a single, powerful, and fully open-source platform. Built with a modern TypeScript stack including React, TanStack Router, Hono, a type-safe REST API, and more.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database:
Local development for a Cloudflare D1 database will already be running as part of the `wrangler dev` command.

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details if needed.

3. Apply the schema to your database:
```bash
bun db:push
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
